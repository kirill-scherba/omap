# Ordered map

Omap is Golang package for working with thread safe ordered maps. The ordered
map contains the golang map, list and mutex to execute Ordered Map functions.

The Ordered Map is a map that remembers the order of items. The map can be
iterated over to retrieve the items in the order they were added.
